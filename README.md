# SOLID Principles

**SOLID** principles are the software design principles that enable us to manage most of the software design problems. SOLID is a set of five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, in the early 2000s.

**SOLID** is an acronym where:

- **S** stands for Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O** stands for Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
- **L** stands for Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I** stands for Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D** stands for Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

In this repository, we embrace the **ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)**. This is what ISP means:

- Clients should not be forced to implement any methods they don’t use. Rather than one fat interface,
    numerous little interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods with each interface serving one submodule.
- A class must not have to implement any interface element that is not required by the particular class.
