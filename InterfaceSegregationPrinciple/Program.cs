/*
  Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).
 This is what ISP means:
 -> Clients should not be forced to implement any methods they don’t use. Rather than one fat interface,
    numerous little interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods with each interface serving one submodule.

 -> A class must not have to implement any interface element that is not required by the particular class.
